# Sudoku_Solver
Usage of Open_CV to complete a sudoku puzzle

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to explore the usage of Optical Character Recognitition (OCR) software and 
Computer Vision libraries like tesseract and opencv to solve sudoku puzzles.

Moving forward the desire would be to allow a web application that would allow you to save some
image from your phone to this application to solve the puzzle for you.
